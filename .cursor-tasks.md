# Project Plan: The Cultural Nuance Navigator

## Phase 0: Project Initiation & Planning

### Epic 0.1: Project Setup & Foundation
**User Story 0.1.1: As a Project Lead, I want to set up the development environment so that the AI agent can start coding.**
* `-[x]` Task: Install and configure necessary IDEs (e.g., VS Code with relevant extensions for React Native/Expo).
* `-[x]` Task: Install and configure React Native and Expo CLI.
* `-[x]` Task: Install and configure Node.js and npm/yarn.
* `-[x]` Task: Install and configure emulators/simulators for iOS and Android.
* `-[x]` Task: Ensure the "culturalai" project directory is correctly configured.

**User Story 0.1.2: As a Project Lead, I want to define the core architecture and technology stack so that development is consistent and scalable.**
* `-[x]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Confirm **React Native with Expo** as the primary mobile development framework. Your `repomix-output.xml` (showing `cultureai/app.json`, `cultureai/App.tsx`, Expo configurations, and `babel.config.js` with `babel-preset-expo`) and your statement confirm this is already established. The AI agent should continue development within this framework.
* `-[x]` Task: Define the primary programming language(s) as TypeScript/JavaScript (already in use per `repomix-output.xml`).
* `-[x]` Task: Select a state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, React Context API - `src/services/authContext.tsx` suggests Context API is in use; confirm if this is the desired global solution).
* `-[x]` Task: Select a navigation library suitable for React Native (e.g., React Navigation - `src/navigation/` suggests this is already in use).
* `-[x]` Task: Define a basic folder structure for the project (e.g., `src/components`, `src/screens`, `src/services`, `src/assets`, `src/utils` - largely in place per `repomix-output.xml`).
* `-[x]` Task: Choose a linting and formatting configuration (e.g., ESLint, Prettier - `package.json` and CI workflows in `.github/workflows/client-ci.yml` suggest ESLint is present).
* `-[x]` Task: Set up basic linting and formatting rules in the project.

**User Story 0.1.3: As a Project Lead, I want to initialize version control so that code changes are tracked and manageable.**
* `-[x]` Task: Initialize a Git repository in the project directory (likely done).
* `-[x]` Task: Create an initial commit with the basic project structure (likely done).
* `-[x]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Your repository "culturalai" is already made. The presence of a `.github/` directory and `.cursor-tasks.md` referring to GitHub implies it's hosted (likely on GitHub). **Verify that the AI agent has appropriate access if it needs to push changes.**
* `-[x]` Task: Create `main`/`develop` branches and define a basic branching strategy (e.g., feature branches).

**User Story 0.1.4: As a Project Lead, I want to define the scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to focus initial development efforts.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Your `.cursor-tasks.md` file contains an "MVP / Live Demo Strategy" section. **Review and affirm this existing MVP scope.** Compare it with this checklist and update your `.cursor-tasks.md` or a separate MVP document if any refinements are needed.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Document the MVP feature set (likely already covered in `.cursor-tasks.md`).

## Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Processing (CultureBank)

**Assumption:** The CultureBank data from `https://github.com/SALT-NLP/CultureBank` is accessible and parsable. You've confirmed it's forked and local.

### Epic 1.1: CultureBank Data Integration
**User Story 1.1.1: As an AI Developer, I want to analyze the CultureBank data structure so that I can effectively parse and utilize it.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Since CultureBank is forked and local:
    1.  Manually inspect your local CultureBank repository structure.
    2.  Identify the file formats used for storing cultural data (e.g., JSON, XML, TXT, MD).
    3.  Determine how data is organized (e.g., by culture, region, category of nuance).
    4.  Identify key data fields available (e.g., culture name, nuance description, category, examples, keywords).
    5.  Document the inferred or actual data schema of your CultureBank fork. This documentation will be crucial for the AI.
    6.  Compare this with your existing database schema (evident in `server/scripts/create_sqlite_db.js` and `create_database.sql`) and decide if your schema needs adaptation or how CultureBank data maps to it.
* `-[ ]` Task: Document the inferred or actual data schema of CultureBank.

**User Story 1.1.2: As an AI Developer, I want to develop a mechanism to ingest CultureBank data into the application project so that it can be processed.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** This is done. The CultureBank repository is forked and local. **Provide the local path of this fork to the AI agent.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Write a script (e.g., Python, Node.js - your server uses Node.js, so a Node.js script in `server/scripts/` would be consistent) to recursively scan the local CultureBank data directory.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement logic in the script to identify relevant data files based on the analysis from Story 1.1.1.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement basic error handling for missing files or directories in the script.

**User Story 1.1.3: As an AI Developer, I want to develop data parsing and cleaning scripts so that the raw CultureBank data is transformed into a usable format.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement parsing logic for the primary data format identified (e.g., JSON.parse, XML parser, Markdown parser).
* `-[ ]` Task: If multiple formats exist, implement parsers for each.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement data cleaning routines:
    * `-[ ]` Task: Trim whitespace from textual data.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Handle potential encoding issues (ensure UTF-8).
    * `-[ ]` Task: Standardize capitalization for key fields (e.g., culture names, categories) if inconsistent.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Handle missing or null values for non-critical fields (e.g., provide defaults).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement logic to extract and structure the key data fields (culture, nuance, category, description, examples, etc.) into a consistent internal object model based on your schema (from Story 1.1.1).
* `-[ ]` Task: Write a script to transform all relevant CultureBank data into a unified intermediate format (e.g., a list of JSON objects, ready for SQLite import).

**User Story 1.1.4: As an AI Developer, I want to design and implement a local data storage solution for the processed cultural data so that the app can access it efficiently.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task or AI Recommendation)** **Best Approach:** Your project already uses **SQLite** on the server-side (`server/utils/database.js`, `server/scripts/create_sqlite_db.js`, `SQLITE_MIGRATION.md`). The mobile client fetches data via API calls (`src/services/cultureService.ts`). **Continue using server-side SQLite.** The plan is to process CultureBank data into this existing database.
* `-[ ]` Task: If SQLite (which is the current setup):
    * `-[ ]` Task: Define/Confirm the database schema (tables, columns, relationships for cultures, nuances, categories, etc. - this is largely defined in `create_database.sql` and `server/scripts/create_sqlite_db.js`. Adapt if needed based on CultureBank analysis).
    * `-[ ]` Task: Write/Update DDL scripts to create/modify the database tables (if schema changes are needed).
    * `-[ ]` Task: Implement a script (likely an extension of `server/scripts/create_sqlite_db.js` or a new one) to populate the SQLite database from the processed CultureBank JSON data.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Integrate an SQLite library into the mobile application project (Expo SQLite can be used if direct client-side DB access is desired for some offline features, but current architecture is API-driven).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement/Update helper functions/service class in the app (`src/services/cultureService.ts`) and backend (`server/routes/cultures.js`, etc.) to query the local data.

## Phase 2: Core Logic - Cultural Insight Engine

### Epic 2.1: Contextual Information & Retrieval
**User Story 2.1.1: As a User, I want to be able to select a specific culture or region so that I can view relevant cultural nuances.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Create a data service method to fetch a list of all available cultures/regions from the server-side SQLite database.
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure this list is unique and sorted alphabetically.

**User Story 2.1.2: As a User, I want the app to attempt to identify my current country/region using device location so that it can suggest relevant cultural information automatically.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Integrate a geolocation library into the app (e.g., `expo-location`).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement logic to request location permissions from the user.
* `-[ ]` Task: Handle cases where permission is denied or location services are off.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a function to get current device coordinates (latitude, longitude).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement or integrate a reverse geocoding service/logic to convert coordinates to a country/region name.
    * `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task if external API key is needed)** **Best Approach:** Your repo doesn't show a reverse geocoding service. If precise location-to-culture mapping (beyond basic device locale) is desired:
        1.  Research and choose a reverse geocoding service (e.g., Google Geocoding API, Nominatim, Here, Mapbox).
        2.  Sign up and obtain an API key.
        3.  Securely store this API key (e.g., in environment variables for the server, similar to `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `server/utils/openai.js` and `server/config/production.js`). The AI can then be instructed to use this key on the backend.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Alternatively, research if CultureBank data includes geographical boundaries for mapping (less likely for precise reverse geocoding).
* `-[ ]` Task: Match the detected country/region with the available cultures in the local data store.
* `-[ ]` Task: Store the auto-detected culture preference (allow user to override).

**User Story 2.1.3: As a User, I want the app to consider my device's language setting as a potential hint for my cultural context.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement logic to get the current device language (e.g., using `expo-localization`).
* `-[ ]` Task: Map device language codes (e.g., "en-US", "fr-FR") to broader culture/region names if possible (this might be approximate).
* `-[ ]` Task: Use this as a secondary factor for suggesting a default culture if location is unavailable or ambiguous.

**User Story 2.1.4: As a User, I want to be able to select a specific scenario (e.g., "Business Meeting," "Dining Out," "Social Gathering") so that I receive nuances relevant to that context.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task or AI based on CultureBank analysis)** **Best Approach:** Your database schema (`create_database.sql`, `server/scripts/create_sqlite_db.js`) includes `Scenarios` and `ScenarioChoices` tables.
    1.  Define a list of common scenarios by analyzing your local CultureBank data or manually curating them.
    2.  This defined list and the structure for each scenario will then be used to populate the `Scenarios` and `ScenarioChoices` tables. The AI can help populate if the data is structured, but the initial definition is human-driven.
* `-[ ]` Task: Store this list of scenarios within the app or fetch from the backend.
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure nuance data in the local store is tagged or categorizable by these scenarios (requires this from CultureBank data or preprocessing step).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a data service method `getNuancesForCultureAndScenario(culture, scenario)` (client-side service calling a backend API).

**User Story 2.1.5: As a User, I want to be able to search for specific keywords (e.g., "punctuality," "gift giving," "eye contact") within the selected culture's nuances so that I can find specific information quickly.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a data service method `searchNuances(culture, keywords)` (client-side service calling a backend API that queries SQLite).
* `-[ ]` Task: This method should search through nuance descriptions, titles, and potentially tags/keywords stored in the SQLite database.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement basic full-text search capabilities if using SQLite (e.g., FTS5 extension), or string matching.
* `-[ ]` Task: Consider stemming or case-insensitivity for better search results.

**User Story 2.1.6: As an AI Developer, I want to develop a basic algorithm for ranking or prioritizing the display of nuances so that the most relevant or common ones are shown first (if applicable).**
* `-[ ]` Task: Analyze if CultureBank data provides any relevance scores, frequency, or importance indicators for nuances.
* `-[ ]` Task: If not, initially sort by a default criterion (e.g., alphabetically by nuance title or by category).
* `-[ ]` Task: (Future Enhancement) Consider adding a simple "importance" field that can be curated or learned. For MVP, simple sorting is fine.

**User Story 2.1.7: As a User, I want to understand "unspoken expectations" which might be subtly different from direct etiquette rules.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task - Data Analysis & Curation)** **Best Approach:** Your `CulturalNorms` table schema (`Description`, `DoBehavior`, `DontBehavior`, `Explanation`) might capture some of this.
    1.  During your local CultureBank analysis, specifically look for how "unspoken expectations" are represented.
    2.  If explicit, map to your schema.
    3.  If implicit or requires inference, this will need human interpretation and curation to be reliably extracted and entered into your CKB. The AI might assist in identifying potential unspoken expectations *if* CultureBank data is very rich and you guide the AI, but final validation will be human.
* `-[ ]` Task: If data supports it, create a specific category or filter for "unspoken expectations."
* `-[ ]` Task: If data doesn't directly support it, this might require significant NLP or manual curation and could be out of scope for an AI-only MVP.

## Phase 3: User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)

### Epic 3.1: Core Application Screens & Navigation
**User Story 3.1.1: As an AI Developer, I want to design and implement the overall app navigation structure (e.g., tab bar, drawer menu) so users can easily move between sections.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Choose a navigation pattern (e.g., bottom tabs for main sections, stack navigation for drill-downs - your `src/navigation/` folder with `MainTab.tsx`, `AuthStack.tsx`, etc., indicates React Navigation with tabs and stacks is already in use).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement the main navigator component using the chosen navigation library.
* `-[ ]` Task: Define routes for all primary screens (largely done in `src/navigation/`).

**User Story 3.1.2: As a User, I want an Onboarding/Welcome experience when I first open the app so that I understand its purpose and how to use it.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Design 2-3 simple onboarding screens explaining the app's value proposition and core features.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement the UI for these onboarding screens (static content, images/icons).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement navigation logic for the onboarding flow.
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure onboarding is shown only on the first launch (use AsyncStorage).
* `-[ ]` Task: During onboarding, request necessary permissions (e.g., location) with clear explanations (leverage `src/components/ConsentModal.tsx` if applicable or create new permission modals).

**User Story 3.1.3: As a User, I want a Home Screen/Dashboard that provides quick access to key features or suggested content.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Design the layout for the Home Screen (`src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` exists).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement UI for displaying the currently selected/detected culture.
* `-[ ]` Task: Add a button/entry point to change/select culture.
* `-[ ]` Task: Add a search bar for keyword search of nuances.
* `-[ ]` Task: Add entry points for selecting scenarios.
* `-[ ]` Task: (Optional) Display a "Nuance of the Day" or recently viewed items.

**User Story 3.1.4: As a User, I want a dedicated screen to select or change my target culture/region.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Design the Culture Selection screen (`src/screens/CultureSelectionScreen.tsx` exists).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a searchable list component to display all available cultures from the data store.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement UI for each list item (e.g., culture name, flag icon).
    * `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task or AI Research - Optional Aesthetic Improvement)** **Best Approach:** Your `CultureSelectionScreen.tsx` and `CulturalBriefingDetailScreen.tsx` already implement a programmatic `CultureFlag` component. This is a good MVP solution. If you want actual flag images:
        1.  Source them (e.g., public domain flag repositories, licensed set).
        2.  Update the `CultureFlag` component to use these images.
        3.  Ensure appropriate licensing.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement logic to update the application's current culture context when a selection is made.
* `-[ ]` Task: Allow users to clear or reset the auto-detected culture.

**User Story 3.1.5: As a User, I want a clear and readable screen to view the details of cultural nuances.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Design the Nuance Display screen (likely part of `CulturalBriefingDetailScreen.tsx`).
* `-[ ]` Task: This screen should show a list of nuances based on selected culture, scenario, or search results.
* `-[ ]` Task: For each nuance in the list:
    * `-[ ]` Task: Display nuance title/summary.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Display nuance category.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Allow tapping on a nuance to see more details.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a Detail View for a single nuance:
    * `-[ ]` Task: Display full description.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Display examples.
    * `-[ ]` Task: Display "dos and don'ts".
    * `-[ ]` Task: Display source or context from CultureBank.
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure text is well-formatted and easy to read.

**User Story 3.1.6: As a User, I want an intuitive interface to search for nuances using keywords.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a search input field on the Home Screen or a dedicated Search Screen.
* `-[ ]` Task: As the user types, trigger the search logic for the current culture.
* `-[ ]` Task: Display search results in a list format.
* `-[ ]` Task: Handle "no results found" gracefully.
* `-[ ]` Task: Include a clear button for the search input.

**User Story 3.1.7: As a User, I want an interface to select a specific scenario to filter nuances.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a UI element to display available scenarios.
* `-[ ]` Task: When a scenario is selected, update the displayed list of nuances.
* `-[ ]` Task: Allow deselecting a scenario.

**User Story 3.1.8: As a User, I want a Settings screen to manage app preferences.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Design the Settings screen (`src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` exists).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement an option to manually enable/disable location services.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement an option to clear app cache or reset data.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement an "About" section with app version, acknowledgments.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a link to a privacy policy. **(Human Task: Create/Finalize Privacy Policy content)** **Best Approach:** Your `src/assets/legal/privacy-policy.tsx` exists. **Review and update its content** to accurately reflect data handling, especially regarding CultureBank and AI analysis. **Legal review is highly recommended.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement a link to terms of service. **(Human Task: Create/Finalize Terms of Service content)** **Best Approach:** Your `src/assets/legal/terms-of-service.tsx` exists. **Review and update its content.** **Legal review is highly recommended.**

**User Story 3.1.9: As a User, I want to be able to provide feedback on the accuracy or usefulness of a specific nuance.**
* `-[ ]` Task: On the Nuance Detail View, add "Helpful" / "Not Helpful" buttons or a simple rating system (Your `src/components/FeedbackButton.tsx` and `src/services/feedbackService.ts` provide a good foundation for this).
* `-[ ]` Task: (MVP scope: Local logging or simple API call) Log this feedback.
* `-[ ]` Task: (Post-MVP: Backend integration) Implement logic to send this feedback to a backend server for analysis.

**User Story 3.1.10: As an AI Developer, I want to ensure the UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and orientations.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Use flexible layout components (React Native's Flexbox is default).
* `-[ ]` Task: Test UI on various device emulators/simulators.
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure no content is cut off or unreadable.
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure touch targets are appropriately sized.

**User Story 3.1.11: As an AI Developer, I want to implement basic accessibility features.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure sufficient color contrast.
* `-[ ]` Task: Add appropriate labels for interactive elements (`accessibilityLabel`).
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure font sizes can be reasonably scaled by OS settings.

## Phase 4: Real-time Interaction & Enhanced Contextualization (Advanced - Consider for Post-MVP or simplified for MVP)

### Epic 4.1: Dynamic Context Updates
**User Story 4.1.1: As a User, I want the app to update suggested cultural information if my location changes significantly while the app is active.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement background location tracking (use with caution, explain to user, ensure battery optimization). **(Complex; consider if essential for MVP)**.
* `-[ ]` Task: Alternatively, re-check location when the app is brought to the foreground.
* `-[ ]` Task: If a significant location change results in a new country/region, prompt the user.

**User Story 4.1.2: As a User, I want to be able to input text (e.g., a phrase I heard) or use my voice to get relevant cultural insights for the current context.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Highly Advanced - Likely Post-MVP)** Integrate a speech-to-text library.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Highly Advanced)** Implement an input field for text queries.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Highly Advanced - Human Task: Strategic decision & NLP expertise)** **Best Approach:** Your `server/utils/openai.js` and `src/services/analysisService.ts` show existing OpenAI integration for text analysis. This is a strong foundation. For advanced real-time conversational analysis (beyond current text block analysis), specialized NLP skills or more sophisticated AI service use might be needed. For MVP, the current text analysis capability is likely sufficient.
* For MVP, this can be simplified to the keyword search already planned (Story 2.1.5) or the existing text analysis feature.

## Phase 5: Personalization & User Management (Optional for MVP)

### Epic 5.1: User Preferences
**User Story 5.1.1: As a User, I want to be able to save my favorite or most useful nuances for quick access later.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Add a "bookmark" or "favorite" icon/button on the Nuance Detail View.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement local storage (AsyncStorage or client-side SQLite via Expo) or backend API to save favorites.
* `-[ ]` Task: Create a "Favorites" screen.
* `-[ ]` Task: Display the list of favorited nuances.
* `-[ ]` Task: Allow users to remove nuances from favorites.

**User Story 5.1.2: As a User, I want the app to remember my recently viewed cultures or nuances.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement local storage or backend API to keep a list of recently viewed items.
* `-[ ]` Task: Display a "Recently Viewed" section.

## Phase 6: Offline Capabilities

### Epic 6.1: Offline Data Access
**User Story 6.1.1: As a User, I want to be able to access cultural information for previously viewed or selected cultures even when I don't have an internet connection.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure the chosen data storage (server-side SQLite with client-side caching, or bundled data/client-side SQLite) supports offline access for key content.
* `-[ ]` Task: Design the app to function primarily from this local/cached data.
* `-[ ]` Task: Handle features requiring internet gracefully when offline.

**User Story 6.1.2: As a User, I want an option to download data for specific cultures for guaranteed offline access (if data isn't bundled entirely).**
* `-[ ]` Task: (If not fully bundled) Implement "Download for Offline" option.
* `-[ ]` Task: (If not fully bundled) Manage storage of downloaded culture packs.

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

### Epic 7.1: Automated & Manual Testing
**User Story 7.1.1: As an AI Developer, I want to write unit tests for core logic and utility functions so that I can ensure their correctness.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Set up a unit testing framework (e.g., Jest - likely present in React Native/Expo).
* `-[ ]` Task: Write unit tests for data parsing, service methods, context detection logic.
* `-[ ]` Task: Aim for reasonable code coverage.

**User Story 7.1.2: As an AI Developer, I want to write integration tests for key user flows so that I can verify components work together.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Set up an integration testing framework (e.g., React Native Testing Library).
* `-[ ]` Task: Write integration tests for culture selection, nuance display, search.

**User Story 7.1.3: As a Project Lead, I need to plan and facilitate User Acceptance Testing (UAT) so that real users can validate the app against their needs.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Your `VERIFICATION_TESTING.md` is a great start. **Leverage and expand this document** to create specific UAT scenarios.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Recruit UAT participants.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Conduct UAT sessions.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Collect and prioritize feedback.
* `-[ ]` Task: Create new tasks/stories for issues/improvements from UAT.

**User Story 7.1.4: As an AI Developer, I want to perform thorough manual testing across different devices and OS versions.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Test all features on target iOS and Android versions.
* `-[ ]` Task: Check for UI consistency and performance.
* `-[ ]` Task: Test offline functionality and permission handling.

## Phase 8: Build & Deployment (Basic)

### Epic 8.1: Application Packaging & Basic Distribution
**User Story 8.1.1: As an AI Developer, I want to prepare build scripts for generating release versions of the mobile application for Android and iOS.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Configure app icons and splash screens (likely in `app.json`).
* `-[ ]` Task: Set up bundle identifiers/application IDs (in `app.json`).
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement code signing for iOS. **(Human Task: Requires Apple Developer Account and certificates)** **Best Approach:** Your project uses Expo. Expo's EAS Build service handles much of this. You need an Apple Developer Account and to configure credentials securely within EAS Build.
* `-[ ]` Task: Implement code signing for Android (generate keystore, configure in Expo build).
* `-[ ]` Task: Create build configurations for debug and release.
* `-[ ]` Task: Write scripts or document steps to build APK/AAB and IPA (EAS Build simplifies this: `expo build:android`, `expo build:ios`). Your `.github/workflows/client-ci.yml` and `scripts/build-mobile-demo.sh` already touch on this.

**User Story 8.1.2: As a Project Lead, I want to set up basic analytics to understand app usage (Post-MVP or if time permits for MVP).**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:**
    1.  Choose an analytics provider (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Mixpanel, Amplitude).
    2.  Create an account and get API keys/configuration files.
    3.  The AI can then be instructed to integrate the SDK.
* `-[ ]` Task: Integrate the analytics SDK.
* `-[ ]` Task: Track basic events (screen views, culture selections, searches).
* `-[ ]` Task: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations.

**User Story 8.1.3: As a Project Lead, I need to handle the app store submission process.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Your `.cursor-tasks.md` (Epic 12) correctly details these as generally post-MVP.
    1.  Create developer accounts for Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
    2.  Prepare app store listing materials (name, description, keywords, screenshots, privacy policy URL from `src/assets/legal/privacy-policy.tsx`).
    3.  Go through the submission process for both stores. This is a manual process.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Prepare app store listing materials.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Go through the submission process for Google Play Store.
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** Go through the submission and review process for Apple App Store.

## Phase 9: Legal & Documentation

### Epic 9.1: Essential Documentation
**User Story 9.1.1: As a Project Lead, I need to ensure a Privacy Policy is available.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Your `src/assets/legal/privacy-policy.tsx` exists. **Review and update its content** to accurately reflect data handling, especially for CultureBank data, location services, and OpenAI API usage. **Legal review is critical.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Make the Privacy Policy accessible within the app (e.g., in Settings) and provide a URL for app store listings.

**User Story 9.1.2: As a Project Lead, I need to ensure Terms of Service are available.**
* `-[ ]` Task: **(Human Task)** **Best Approach:** Your `src/assets/legal/terms-of-service.tsx` exists. **Review and update its content.** **Legal review is critical.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Make the Terms of Service accessible within the app.

**User Story 9.1.3: As an AI Developer, I want to ensure all data sources (like CultureBank) are properly attributed.**
* `-[ ]` Task: Check CultureBank's license and attribution requirements from your local fork.
* `-[ ]` Task: Add an "Acknowledgements" or "About" section in the app that includes proper attribution.

This checklist is extensive and aims for thoroughness. The AI Coding Agent should be able to tackle a significant portion of these tasks, especially the coding and setup ones. If you need human intervention, express that in away to make the human understand what it needs to do. Remember to review and adjust priorities based on the desired MVP scope. Good luck!
