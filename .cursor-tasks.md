* [ ] Task: Review H1 styling (e.g., `text-3xl sm:text-4xl`) and adjust Tailwind classes if necessary for optimal mobile display.
* [ ] Task: Review H2 styling (e.g., `text-2xl sm:text-3xl` for Epics, `text-xl sm:text-2xl` for other sections) and adjust Tailwind classes if needed for mobile.
* [ ] Task: Review H3 styling (e.g., `text-lg sm:text-xl` for User Stories) and adjust Tailwind classes if needed for mobile.

**Meta-User Story 2.2: As a reader, I want paragraph text and list items in the project plan HTML document to maintain readable font sizes and line heights on mobile devices.**
* [ ] Task: Confirm the base text size (e.g., `text-sm sm:text-base` via Tailwind) is suitable for comfortable reading on mobile screens.
* [ ] Task: Verify that line height (e.g., `leading-relaxed`) contributes to good readability for blocks of text on mobile.

**Meta-User Story 2.3: As a reader, I want margins and padding around sections and elements in the project plan HTML document to be adjusted for mobile, preventing overly cramped or excessively sparse layouts.**
* [ ] Task: Evaluate and adjust `mb-*` (margin-bottom) Tailwind classes for header elements, Epic sections, and User Story blocks to ensure appropriate vertical spacing on mobile.
* [ ] Task: Evaluate and adjust `p-*` (padding) Tailwind classes for container elements (Overview, Platforms, Legend, Epic sections, User Story blocks) for optimal internal spacing on mobile.
* [ ] Task: Review `gap-*` (gap) Tailwind classes in grid layouts (like for Platforms/Legend) to ensure adequate spacing on mobile.

### Meta-Epic 4: General Mobile Usability & Testing for Project Plan HTML Document

**Goal:** Address overall mobile usability aspects and perform testing to confirm the mobile-friendliness of the HTML project plan document.

**Meta-User Story 4.1: As a reader, I want to view the project plan HTML document on mobile devices without encountering any horizontal scrolling.**
* [ ] Task: Thoroughly test the HTML document across various simulated mobile screen widths and on actual devices to identify and rectify any elements causing horizontal overflow.
* [ ] Task: If any images are present or added later, ensure they use responsive Tailwind classes (e.g., `max-w-full h-auto`) to prevent them from breaking the layout.

**Meta-User Story 4.2: As a reader, I want any interactive elements (like links, if present) in the project plan HTML document to be easily tappable on mobile devices.**
* [ ] Task: (If applicable) For any hyperlinks or future interactive elements, ensure they have sufficient padding or an adequate target size to be easily and accurately tapped on touchscreens. (Currently, the document is mostly static).

**Meta-User Story 4.3: As a developer, I want to ensure all custom CSS (if any beyond Tailwind) in the project plan HTML document is reviewed for mobile compatibility.**
* [ ] Task: Review the `<style>` block in the HTML document for any custom CSS rules and ensure they do not conflict with mobile responsiveness or introduce mobile-specific issues.
* [ ] Task: Specifically check the custom scrollbar CSS (`::-webkit-scrollbar`) to ensure it doesn't negatively impact mobile views (though it typically only applies to desktop browsers that support it).
